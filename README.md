SuperSet is a card matching game based off of another card game called "Set". 
Given a board of eight cards, you must select a set where the characteristic of each dimension for each card is either all the same or all different.
The number of cards in a set is determined by the minimum chosen dimension.
Dimensions can changed according to the directions displayed on the left-hand side of the screen.
